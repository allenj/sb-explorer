              Development of the Biocomplexity Thesaurus began in 2002-2003 through a partnership between the former USGS NBII Program and ProQuest (formerly CSA), a worldwide information company with more than 30 years experience as a leading bibliographic database provider.

            <p>
              Researchers collect species occurrence data, records of an organism at a particular time in a particular place, as a primary or ancillary function of many biological field investigations. Presently, these data reside in numerous distributed systems and formats (including publications) and are consequently not being used to their full potential. As a step toward addressing this challenge, the Core Science Analytics and Synthesis (CSAS) program of the US Geological Survey (USGS) is developing Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON), an integrated and permanent resource for biological occurrence data from the United States.

              The John Wesley Powell Center for Earth System Analysis and Synthesis supports proposal driven working groups to examine some of the most pressing questions and needs for scientific synthesis across the USGS Mission Areas. Working groups are funded to work with existing data as opposed to collecting new data, and the data synthesis results of all projects are published along with journal articles and other products. ScienceBase provides the data backbone for Powell Center working groups. It is used to catalog data and information resources used by the working groups and is the repository for products coming out of the working groups. Wherever possible, new data from working groups are made part of some larger data system or collection in ScienceBase. ScienceBase is also used to publish algorithms, models, synthesized information products, and other artifacts from the research process.

Several different databases and indexes will be aggregated to create this data resource, with ScienceBase taking on the role of original master data source for some legacy collections. The database and this ScienceBase community will be organized into various collections and sets of data based on their original sources. Items found in the community will generally be records of samples with associated details about when, how, and where they were collected along with observations made on the samples by paleontologists.
